# 🔍 PARITY PROTOCOL - COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT & REVIEW DOCUMENT

## 📋 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**PARITY Protocol** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) system that creates a synthetic ERC-20 token called **PARITY** that tracks the market capitalization ratio between **Kusama (KSM)** and **Polkadot (DOT)**. The protocol allows users to mint PARITY tokens using KSM, DOT, or dUSD as collateral, and provides various mechanisms for maintaining stability and generating yield.

## 💰 **HOW THE PROTOCOL WORKS (Simple Explanation)**

### **🎯 What is PARITY?**
PARITY is like a **digital certificate** that represents the relationship between two popular cryptocurrencies: Kusama (KSM) and Polkadot (DOT). When you own PARITY tokens, you're essentially betting on how these two cryptocurrencies perform relative to each other.

### **🔄 The Basic Process:**

#### **1. MINTING (Creating PARITY tokens):**
```
User deposits: 100 KSM (worth $3,000)
↓
Protocol takes: 0.3% fee ($9) + 10% for bonuses ($300)
↓
User receives: PARITY tokens worth $2,691
↓
Collateral goes to: Reserve Vault for backing
```

#### **2. BURNING (Redeeming PARITY tokens):**
```
User burns: 1000 PARITY tokens
↓
Protocol calculates: Current value + any bonuses earned
↓
Protocol takes: 10% for NAV Vault + 0.3% fee
↓
User receives: KSM, DOT, or dUSD (their choice)
```

#### **3. NAV BONUSES (Extra Rewards):**
- When you burn PARITY tokens, you might get **bonus rewards**
- These bonuses come from the 10% of deposits that go to the NAV Vault
- The longer you hold, the more bonuses you might earn

## 🔒 **COLLATERAL RATIO SYSTEM (Production Values)**

The protocol uses different **safety thresholds** for different operations:

### **📊 Production Collateral Ratios:**

| Operation | Ratio | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Minting** | 0% | No minimum required | Can mint anytime |
| **Trading** | 120% | Need $120 backing per $100 PARITY | Safe trading |
| **Loan Repayment** | 110% | Need $110 backing per $100 loan | Moderate safety |
| **Surplus Transfer** | 150% | Need $150 backing per $100 PARITY | High safety |
| **Circuit Breaker** | 95% | Emergency stop if below $95 per $100 | Emergency protection |

### **🛡️ What This Means:**
- **Higher ratios = More safety** but less flexibility
- **Lower ratios = More flexibility** but higher risk
- The protocol automatically checks these ratios before allowing operations

## 💡 **DETAILED OPERATION FLOWS**

### **🟢 MINTING FLOW (Creating PARITY)**

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **User Action:** Deposits KSM, DOT, or dUSD
2. **Fee Calculation:** Protocol takes 0.3% fee
3. **NAV Allocation:** 10% goes to NAV Vault (for future bonuses)
4. **Reserve Storage:** Remaining 89.7% goes to Reserve Vault
5. **Token Issuance:** User receives PARITY tokens
6. **Position Tracking:** User's position is recorded for future bonuses

#### **Example - Minting with 100 KSM:**
```
User deposits: 100 KSM ($3,000)
├── Fee (0.3%): 0.3 KSM ($9) → Protocol fees
├── NAV (10%): 10 KSM ($300) → NAV Vault (for bonuses)
└── Reserve (89.7%): 89.7 KSM ($2,691) → Reserve Vault

User receives: 2,691 PARITY tokens
User position recorded: 2,691 PARITY at current NAV ratio
```

### **🔴 BURNING FLOW (Redeeming PARITY)**

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **User Action:** Burns PARITY tokens
2. **NAV Bonus Calculation:** Calculates any earned bonuses
3. **Gross Amount Calculation:** Base value + NAV bonus
4. **NAV Allocation:** Takes 10% of gross amount for NAV Vault
5. **Protocol Fee:** Takes 0.3% fee from remaining amount
6. **Asset Transfer:** Sends net assets to user
7. **Position Update:** Updates user's position

#### **Example - Burning 1000 PARITY for KSM:**
```
User burns: 1000 PARITY tokens
├── Base value: $1,000 worth of KSM
├── NAV bonus: +$50 worth of KSM (if earned)
├── Gross total: $1,050 worth of KSM
├── NAV allocation (10%): -$105 → Goes to NAV Vault
├── After NAV allocation: $945
├── Protocol fee (0.3% of $945): -$2.84
└── User receives: $942.16 worth of KSM

Final: ~31.4 KSM (at $30/KSM price)
Total effective cost: 10.3% (10% NAV + 0.3% protocol fee)
```

### **🔄 MULTI-ASSET BURNING FLOW**

#### **When User Burns for Multiple Assets:**
```
User burns: 2000 PARITY tokens
├── Protocol calculates proportional amounts based on available liquidity:
│   ├── KSM portion: 33.33% = 666.67 PARITY worth
│   ├── DOT portion: 33.33% = 666.67 PARITY worth
│   └── dUSD portion: 33.33% = 666.67 PARITY worth
├── Adds NAV bonuses to each portion
├── Calculates gross amounts for each asset
├── Deducts 10% NAV allocation from each asset → Goes to NAV Vault
├── Deducts 0.3% protocol fee from remaining amounts
└── Transfers net amounts of all three assets to user

Total effective cost per asset: 10.3% (10% NAV + 0.3% protocol fee)
```

## 🏦 **VAULT SYSTEM EXPLAINED**

### **🏛️ Reserve Vault (The Main Bank)**
- **Purpose:** Holds the main collateral backing PARITY tokens
- **Contents:** KSM, DOT, and dUSD from user deposits
- **Safety:** Requires 120% collateral for trading operations
- **Access:** Only protocol can withdraw for legitimate operations

#### **Reserve Vault Operations:**
```
Deposits → Reserve Vault → Backs PARITY tokens
                      ↓
              Used for user redemptions
                      ↓
              Surplus transferred when >150% backed
```

### **💎 NAV Vault (The Bonus Pool)**
- **Purpose:** Accumulates assets to provide bonuses to PARITY holders
- **Contents:** 10% of all minting deposits + 10% of all burning outputs
- **Mechanism:** Automatically rebalances to maintain 50/50 KSM/DOT ratio
- **Distribution:** Provides bonuses when users burn PARITY tokens

#### **NAV Vault Operations:**
```
10% of minting deposits → NAV Vault → Grows over time
                               ↓
10% of burning outputs → NAV Vault → Accumulates assets
                               ↓
                       Provides bonuses to users
                               ↓
                       Can provide loans to protocol
```

### **🛡️ Insurance Vault (The Safety Net)**
- **Purpose:** Provides emergency coverage for the protocol
- **Contents:** Insurance deposits + 50% of all protocol fees
- **Trigger:** Automatically recharges reserves if collateral drops below 95%
- **Management:** Admin-controlled for emergency situations

#### **Insurance Vault Operations:**
```
Insurance deposits → Insurance Vault → Monitors protocol health
                              ↓
50% of protocol fees → Insurance Vault → Accumulates emergency funds
                              ↓
                      Auto-recharge if needed
                              ↓
                      Maintains protocol stability
```

---

## ⚖️ **ORACLE SYSTEM & PRICE FEEDS**

### **🔮 5-Oracle Consensus Architecture:**

The protocol uses **exactly 5 oracle providers** to ensure reliable price data:

#### **Oracle Sources:**
1. **Primary Oracle** - Main price feed provider
2. **Secondary Oracle** - Backup price validation
3. **Tertiary Oracle** - Additional consensus participant
4. **Quaternary Oracle** - Fourth consensus validator
5. **Fallback Oracle** - Emergency price source

#### **Consensus Mechanism:**
- **Minimum Consensus:** Requires agreement from **at least 3 out of 5 oracles**
- **Price Validation:** Each oracle reports KSM, DOT, and dUSD prices
- **Outlier Detection:** Automatically excludes prices that deviate significantly
- **Weighted Average:** Final price calculated from valid oracle responses
- **Bootstrap Mode:** Starts with fewer oracles, scales to full 5-oracle consensus

#### **Consensus Process:**
```
Step 1: All 5 oracles report prices
Step 2: System validates each price for reasonableness
Step 3: Excludes outliers (>10% deviation from median)
Step 4: Requires minimum 3 valid prices for consensus
Step 5: Calculates weighted average of valid prices
Step 6: Updates protocol with consensus prices
```

### **📊 Price Data Tracked:**
1. **KSM Price** (in USD)
2. **DOT Price** (in USD)
3. **dUSD Price** (should stay ~$1.00)
4. **KSM Market Cap**
5. **DOT Market Cap**
6. **KSM/DOT Ratio** (the key metric for PARITY)

### **🎯 How Ratio Affects PARITY:**
```
If KSM market cap grows faster than DOT:
├── KSM/DOT ratio increases
├── PARITY token value adjusts accordingly
└── Users holding PARITY benefit from the change

If DOT market cap grows faster than KSM:
├── KSM/DOT ratio decreases
├── PARITY token value adjusts accordingly
└── Users holding PARITY are affected by the change
```

## 🔄 **AUTOMATED SYSTEMS**

### **🤖 Surplus Management:**
- **Monitoring:** Continuously checks if reserves exceed 150% backing
- **Transfer:** Automatically moves surplus to designated recipient
- **Frequency:** Configurable check intervals (default: daily)
- **Safety:** Only transfers when protocol is over-collateralized

### **⚖️ Auto-Rebalancing (NAV Vault):**
- **Target:** Maintains 50/50 KSM/DOT ratio in NAV Vault
- **Trigger:** Activates when ratio deviates significantly
- **Method:** Uses internal PMM (Proactive Market Maker) for swaps
- **Benefit:** Optimizes bonus distribution and reduces risk

### **🚨 Insurance Auto-Recharge:**
- **Monitoring:** Watches protocol collateral ratio
- **Trigger:** Activates if ratio drops below 95%
- **Action:** Transfers assets from Insurance Vault to Reserve Vault
- **Goal:** Maintains protocol stability automatically

### **🔥 KSM Burn System (Deflationary Mechanism):**
- **Purpose:** Burns KSM tokens to create deflationary pressure
- **Fee Source:** Receives 50% of all protocol fees
- **KSM Processing:** Direct burning to dead address (0x...dEaD)
- **DOT/dUSD Processing:** Automatic swap to KSM via PMM, then burn
- **Buffer System:** FeeConversionBuffer handles failed swaps due to liquidity
- **Retry Logic:** Automated attempts to process buffered fees when liquidity improves

### **⚙️ User-Triggered Maintenance System:**
- **Trigger Method:** Every user operation (mint/burn/trade) triggers maintenance
- **Operations Covered:** PARITY minting, burning, multi-asset burning, and PMM trading
- **Gas-Efficient:** Only executes if sufficient gas remaining (>50,000)
- **Atomic Operations:** Maintenance runs after user operation completes
- **Flag System:** Sets execution flags for complex operations (NAV rebalance, surplus transfer)
- **External Execution:** Anyone can execute flagged operations for rewards
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes insurance recharge, NAV loans, rebalancing, and surplus management

### **🕐 External Trigger System (Cron Jobs):**
- **MasterTrigger Contract:** Single function call (`triggerAll()`) maintains entire protocol
- **Public Access:** Anyone can call trigger functions (permissionless maintenance)
- **Cron Job Integration:** Perfect for automated external maintenance systems
- **Time Gates:** Prevents spam with minimum intervals between operations

### **💰 NAV Loan System (Emergency Liquidity):**
- **Purpose:** NAV Vault provides emergency loans to Reserve Vault
- **Loan Trigger:** Activates when collateral ratio drops below 100%
- **Loan Terms:** Interest-free emergency loans (up to 80% of NAV assets)
- **Repayment Trigger:** Automatic repayment when collateral ratio exceeds 120%
- **Priority:** Loan repayments have priority over surplus transfers
- **Assets:** Can loan KSM, DOT, and dUSD based on availability

#### **NAV Loan Operations:**
```
Emergency Situation:
├── Collateral ratio drops below 100%
├── NAV Vault automatically loans assets to Reserve Vault
├── Protocol stability maintained
└── Normal operations continue

Recovery Situation:
├── Collateral ratio improves above 120%
├── Reserve Vault automatically repays NAV Vault
├── NAV bonuses resume normal distribution
└── System returns to optimal state
```

```

### **🔄 Fee Flow Summary:**
```
MINTING FLOW:
User Input → Protocol Fee (0.3%) → NAV Allocation (10%) → Reserves (89.7%)

BURNING FLOW:
Gross Output → NAV Allocation (10%) → Protocol Fee (0.3%) → User Receives (89.7%)
```

### **🔥 Protocol Fee Distribution System:**

#### **Fee Split (50/50):**
```
Protocol Fees (0.3%) → Split into two equal parts:
├── 50% → Insurance Vault (for emergency coverage)
└── 50% → KSM Burn System (for supply reduction)
```

#### **KSM Burn System Operations:**
- **KSM Fees**: Immediately burned (sent to dead address)
- **DOT Fees**: Swapped to KSM via PMM, then burned
- **dUSD Fees**: Swapped to KSM via PMM, then burned
- **Buffer System**: If swaps fail due to liquidity, fees accumulate in FeeConversionBuffer
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automated attempts to convert buffered fees when liquidity improves

#### **Insurance Vault Operations:**
- **Purpose**: Receives 50% of all protocol fees for emergency coverage
- **Assets**: Accumulates KSM, DOT, and dUSD from fee distribution
- **Auto-Recharge**: Automatically transfers assets to Reserve Vault when collateral < 95%
- **Emergency Role**: Admin can manually withdraw for crisis situations

### **🔄 User-Triggered Maintenance Operations:**

#### **Atomic Operation Flow:**
```
User Transaction (Mint/Burn/Trade):
├── 1. Execute user operation (mint/burn PARITY or PMM trade)
├── 2. Distribute fees (50% insurance + 50% KSM burn)
├── 3. Check remaining gas (>50,000 required)
├── 4. Execute maintenance operations:
│   ├── Reset daily limits if needed
│   ├── Trigger ProtocolManager maintenance
│   ├── Set NAV rebalance flag (if needed)
│   └── Set surplus transfer flag (if needed)
└── 5. Emit operation completed event
```

#### **External Trigger Flow (Cron Jobs):**
```
Cron Job / External Caller:

- **Economic Incentives**: Executors receive ETH rewards for maintenance
- **Gas Efficiency**: Flag setting costs ~2,000 gas per operation

#### **Timing & Intervals:**
- **NAV Rebalancing**: Minimum 1 hour interval between operations
- **Surplus Transfer**: Minimum 6 hours interval between operations
- **Surplus Checks**: Default 24 hours interval (configurable)
- **Daily Limits**: Reset every 24 hours automatically
- **Reward Amounts**: 0.001 ETH for NAV rebalance, 0.002 ETH for surplus transfer

### **💡 Important Notes:**
- **NAV Allocation is NOT a fee** - it funds bonuses that users can earn back
- **Total effective cost is 10.3%** for both minting and burning
- **NAV bonuses can offset the 10% allocation** over time
- **Protocol fees are much smaller (0.3%)** than NAV allocations (10%)
- **KSM burning creates deflationary pressure** on KSM supply
- **Insurance vault provides multi-layer protection** for protocol stability
- **User operations trigger protocol maintenance** automatically
- **Maintenance never fails user transactions** due to flag-based system
